# TOEND: Theory of Entropic Numbers and Dynamics

TOEND is an interdisciplinary research framework that models complex systems through the interaction of memory (Âµ), entropy (Ïƒ), and tension (Î»). It integrates formal theory, simulations, and poetic-sociological insights into a unified architecture.

## ðŸ”¸ Folder Structure

- `0_CORE/` â€“ Foundational axioms, summary PDFs, versioned syntheses.
- `1_THEORY_MODELS/` â€“ Lambda dynamics, fractal tensors, entropic equations.
- `2_SIMULATION_CODE/` â€“ PDEs, NS2D simulations, identity engine.
- `3_EPISTEMES_POETICS/` â€“ Cognitive, symbolic and social theory documents.
- `4_VISUALS_DATA/` â€“ CSVs, hypothesis diagrams, raw inputs and metrics.

## ðŸ“¡ Status

This version is the result of a major cleanup and freeze (May 2025).  
The project is open for contribution and discussion. Discord link to follow.
