# Lambda Module (λ)

This module formalizes the tension operator λ between coherence (µ) and entropy (σ) in the TOEND framework.

## Contents

- `lambda_equations.md`: Unified differential expression for λ and its physical interpretation.
- `lambda_typology.csv`: Regimes of λ (resilience, collapse, saturation) with equations and context.
- `lambda_visual.png`: Diagram of λ zones and critical thresholds.
- `lambda_monitor.py` (optional): Computes λ given µ, σ, and E inputs.

## Purpose

λ is the central diagnostic and control parameter of the TOEND model. It quantifies dynamic tension in any evolving system balancing order and disorder under energy constraints.

This module is ready for simulation, publication, and integration.
